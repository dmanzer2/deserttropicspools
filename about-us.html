  				<h3>Our Process</h3>
  			</div>

        <p>When you call on Desert Tropics Pools for a pool project quote, we don’t come out and SELL you a pool. Or first meeting is to LISTEN to your ideas, evaluate and discuss the options available and to determine what style and overall feel you are trying to achieve. After an assessment of the area is performed and careful measurements are taken, our designers then create a detailed, professional pool and hardscape design for your review using the best 3D design software available to the industry. We will continue to fine tune the design until it is exactly what you envisioned.</p>
        <p>After the design is finalized, leave the rest to us. We take care of the permits, inspections and even teach you how to operate your new pool once it is completed.</p>
        <p>Questions? That’s why we are here. Call us anytime...</p>

  				<h3>Use this handy checklist while searching for a pool company.</h3>
  			</div>

        <div class="accordion accordion-bg bottommargin topmargin clearfix">
  				<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-ok-circle"></i><i class="acc-open icon-remove-circle"></i>Is the company Licensed, Bonded and Insured?</div>
  				<div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none;">
            Check with the Registrar of Contractors at <a href="http://www.rc.state.az.us/" target="_blank">http://www.rc.state.az.us/</a> If a builder is not Licensed, there is no recourse through the state of Arizona. This site will also allow you to check any recent complaints. CAUTION: if it is a new pool builder, there may not be ample time in business for complaints to surface.
            <br /><br />
            Search under the company name, but also under the names of the principals of the company.
          </div>

          <div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-ok-circle"></i><i class="acc-open icon-remove-circle"></i>Is the price substantially lower than other bids?</div>
  				<div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none;">Newer companies tend to have lower prices for several reasons. Possibly, they don’t have the longevity or experience to know the true costs of running a successful construction business (overhead, warranties, etc.). They may be able to build a nice pool but will not have the necessary cash reserves to keep the doors open when the business slows down, or warranty work eats up their minimal profit. Or, they have no plans to be around 3 years from now.<br /><br />
          One example we have seen many times in the valley are from companies being owned by individuals who have already gone out of business under several different company names. They know how to penetrate the market on price and collect the money…. it’s the staying open that seems to elude them. Not only is this bad for the consumers, it has the trickledown effect of putting a lot of honest people out of business.
          </div>

          <div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-ok-circle"></i><i class="acc-open icon-remove-circle"></i>Is the pool design professional and comprehensive with measurements that are accurate?</div>
  				<div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none;">If you are given a sketch that could have been done on the back of a napkin…BEWARE. The same expertise and consideration will be given to the building of your pool. It takes time and experience to create a detailed and accurate backyard design in a 3D format that allows you to truly see what your finished project will look like.</div>

          <div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-ok-circle"></i><i class="acc-open icon-remove-circle"></i>Who is the Qualifying Party for the license?</div>
  				<div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none;">It is important to know that the owner of the company also has the appropriate expertise in the industry and can resolve any issues that may arise during and after the construction of your pool.</div>

          <div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-ok-circle"></i><i class="acc-open icon-remove-circle"></i>Is the owner of the company accessable?</div>
  				<div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none;">Ask if you can have the phone number of the owner. This will tell you how much you can trust the company to be accountable for any issues that may arise.</div>

          <div class="acctitle" style="line-height:20px; padding-top:12px; padding-bottom:12px;"><i class="acc-closed icon-ok-circle"></i><i class="acc-open icon-remove-circle"></i>How many people will you be dealing with after the contract is signed? And will the sales person be on site during the construction in case there are any misunderstandings between what you were sold and what is being built?</div>
  				<div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none;">Let’s face it. Salespeople are commissioned and earn their living by getting contracts. It is a good indication that you can trust the integrity of the company to deliver on what was sold if your salesperson is going to be there throughout the process to ensure your satisfaction.</div>

          <div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-ok-circle"></i><i class="acc-open icon-remove-circle"></i>Is everything you are promised in WRITING and in the contract?</div>
  				<div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none;">If it isn’t in writing, there is no recourse. The state of Arizona can only enforce what is written in the contract. Read it carefully. Some salespeople love to use the “of course that will be included” sales technique, to close a deal. Make sure you receive a detailed quote for your project and make sure all “promises” are in the contract before you sign!</div>

          <div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-ok-circle"></i><i class="acc-open icon-remove-circle"></i>Is the company promising a fast/short construction time?</div>
          <div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none;">Beware of the short construction time promise! For a couple of reasons…first is attention to quality construction practices and details. If they are moving trades right on the tail of other contractors, or sooner, things can be missed, or forgotten. Secondly, what is the hurry! Plan your project start time giving your builder plenty of time for project to be completed correctly, so that they can line up their “A-team”.  Using the best crews can sometimes result in a slightly longer build times and is normally better than trying to fill those construction gaps with whatever subcontractor they can find on a moment’s notice. (There are reasons for subcontractors to be readily available, many times related to their quality of work). Don’t plan the party until your project is complete, and you will then have a real reason to celebrate!</div>

          <div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-ok-circle"></i><i class="acc-open icon-remove-circle"></i>Is the record with the Better Business Bureau and the Registrar of Contractors clean?</div>
          <div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none;">While misunderstandings or defects can always occur during construction, it is how a company responds to the complaint that defines them. If there are any issues, check to make sure they were resolved.</div>

          <div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-ok-circle"></i><i class="acc-open icon-remove-circle"></i>Is the builder willing to give references?</div>
          <div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none;">Any good company will gladly give a few references. Be sure to call several different previous customers.</div>

          <div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-ok-circle"></i><i class="acc-open icon-remove-circle"></i>How long has the company been in business?</div>
          <div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none;">The financial stability and reputation of a company can only be discovered over time.  Charisma should never be confused with capability.</div>
          
          <div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-ok-circle"></i><i class="acc-open icon-remove-circle"></i>Do you feel comfortable with the sales person and the staff?</div>
          <div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none;">Trust your intuition after checking out all the facts. If something doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t.</div>

                <p>I had some work done on my pool. Well, that is an understatement. I had my pool redone in March of '06. I went the typical route; I had 3 estimates, chose the least expensive and signed the contract. It wasn't long before I began to feel uncomfortable (always trust your instincts). To make a long story short, I cancelled the contract and went with Exotic Pools. Not the least expensive, but they did go out of the way to make sure everything was just as I wanted it. I was out of town most of the time and they kept in touch, letting me know how things were going. The pool is beautiful and I want to thank you for making things so easy, and for keeping me informed. It is not often you run into a company where customer service and integrity are a priority! Thank You!</p>
