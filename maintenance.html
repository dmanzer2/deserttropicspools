      <h4>Weekly Maintenance</h4>
    </div>
    <p>(basic maintenance described below, for other equipment, consult manufacturers service manuals) 
Weekly maintenance should be minimal when everything is working properly.</p>
    <p>1. Empty skimmer and leaf trapper baskets whenever full. These should be checked weekly unless there has been winds or storm causing more than normal debris in pool, in which case it should be checked more frequently.</p>
    <p>2. Test water chemistry weekly using a reliable test kit. (Test kits and strips are best not kept outdoors exposed to weather and sunlight). Consult test kit instructions for recommended levels.</p>
    <p>3. Verify pool water level is correct, if not, check automatic water leveler operation.</p>
    <p>4. Net surface debris from pool surface, and brush pool walls, steps, benches, and floor weekly.</p>
    <p>5. Check filter pressure and compare to clean pressure you recorded at startup or following last filter cleaning. A good rule of thumb is to backwash or clean when filter pressure exceeds clean pressure by 10lbs, but do consult manufactures operating and service information for you particular filter.</p>

      <h4>Monthly Maintenance</h4>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Salt Cell</strong> (consult manufacturerâ€™s instructions before cleaning!)</p>
    <p>These are general guidelines and may not apply to all salt systems.</p>
    <p>Have garden hose ready with nozzle attached and water turned on before starting cell cleaning procedure.</p>
    <p>Remove salt cell by unscrewing unions at each end of cell (counter clockwise to remove)</p>
    <p>Visually inspect interior of cell and use garden hose to spray any debris from inside of cell prior to acid treatment.</p>
    <p>To clean the cell, screw the cleaning plug onto one end of cell, then stand that end of cell on ground, leaning against something stable to hold the open end upward.</p>
    <p>Be careful when using muriatic acid, and avoid any contact with skin, clothing, or metal objects. Rinse immediately with water should it come into contact with your skin or anything other than the inside of salt cell.</p>
    <p>Fill cell 3/4 full of water, and then fill the remainder with muriatic acid (always add the acid to water, and not water to acid!). Then let it bubble, and when it stops bubbling the cell should be clean.</p>
    <p>Dump acid solution from cell into plastic bucket, place bucket in a safe place where it will not be bothered by children or animals and allow it to evaporate.</p>
    <p>Remove plug and check for debris between salt cell plates, hose out if needed. Repeat cleaning if necessary.</p>
    <p>Reinstall salt cell. Run pump, check for leaks, and reset service light on control unit if it is lit.
    </p> 
    <p><strong>DE Filters</strong> (See manufacturers service manual for service of your DE filter)<br />
    As a general rule, DE filters should be backwashed and recharged monthly (in some case more often depending on filter pressure (see mfg. service manual), and fully serviced annually.</p>

    <div class="fancy-title title-border-color title-left">
      <h4>Every 6 Months (or more often depending on filter pressure)</h4>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Cartridge Filter cleaning</strong> (See manufacturers service manual for service of your cartridge filter)</p>
    <p>The following instructions apply for most multi cartridge filters.</p>
    <p>When performing filter service, it is recommended to turn off filter pump circuit breaker, to prevent pump coming on while cleaning is being performed.</p>
    <p>Remove filter cartridges from filter housing, by removing band using socket and ratchet, open air relief valve on top of filter to allow water to drain down, then remove lid. (refer to service manual for your specific filter).</p>
    <p>Then remove "X shaped" piece atop 4 cartridges, and then remove each cartridge and hose off the off until clean.<br />  
    You might also soak cartridges first in a large bucket/plastic garbage can, with filter cleaning solution to loosen debris, prior to hosing off.</p>
    <p>Once clean, reinstall the cartridges and reassemble the filter.</p>
    <p>Once filter is put back together, run pump and check for leaks. Leave air relief open until air exists filter tank, then close the air relief valve.
    </p>
 
    <p>If you have a heater, you may want to take this opportunity to run it for a few minutes to ensure it is working while running the pump, and checking the filter, pump(s) and plumbing for leaks, then turn heater off allowing it to cool down, and then turn off pump (unless you have a control system that allows heater cool down automatically).
