				<h2 class="bottommargin">What to Look for When Choosing a Pool Builder</h2>
				<p>A swimming pool is an investment that can be a dream come true, or a nightmare. There really is no second chance without involving a large expense. Phoenix has the great fortune of being one of the largest growth areas in the country. Along with that growth comes many new swimming pool businesses to take advantage of the high demand in swimming pools. In the last decade, dozens of swimming pool companies have gone out of business and been replaced by dozens of new swimming pool companies. For the short-term swimming pool companies, price is the best tool for them to compete in the swimming pool industry. They only need to stay in business long enough to collect the money. There is little attention paid to having the financial resources needed to provide ongoing customer service and be able to warranty their pools, because there is often no long-term business plan. Consumers must be careful in their search and seek reputable swimming pool companies with long term stability and ethics along with a nice portfolio.
				</p>
				<p>Many consumers mistakenly base their buying decisions on price, or a friend recommends someone who “builds pools on the side”. These can be pitfalls that will end up costing you time, money and a lot of frustration. The following information is designed to give you some important factors to consider for increasing the chances of success in your swimming pool project.
				</p>
				<p>At Desert Tropics Pools we strive to understand our customers' dreams, desires and vision for the design and function of their swimming pools and outdoor environment. While the custom design is the foundation for a superior experience, please take the time to review some frequently asked questions and inspiring ideas for optimizing your experience building your own custom swimming pool.</p>
