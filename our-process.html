      <p>When you call on Desert Tropics Pools for a pool project quote, we don’t come out and SELL you a pool. Or first meeting is to LISTEN to your ideas, evaluate and discuss the options available and to determine what style and overall feel you are trying to achieve. After an assessment of the area is performed and careful measurements are taken, our designers then create a detailed, professional pool and hardscape design for your review using the best 3D design software available to the industry. We will continue to fine tune the design until it is exactly what you envisioned.</p>
      <p>After the design is finalized, leave the rest to us. We take care of the permits, inspections and even teach you how to operate your new pool once it is completed.</p>
      <p>Questions? That’s why we are here. Call us anytime...</p>
