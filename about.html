      <p><span class="dropcap">D</span>esert Tropics Custom Pools has been building pools in the Valley since 2001. Our President is also the Qualifying Party for our license. We don’t strive to build the most pools in the Valley, though we do strive to build the best pools in the Valley. We never use a template to put a pool in your yard. Each pool is custom designed by a professional, to meet your lifestyle and enhance the value of your home and your everyday enjoyment. We know all of our customers by name and our staff is dedicated to making sure that your needs are met. Most of our business comes to us by referral, and we strive to give every customer the best experience possible.</p>
      <p>Our designers, Doug Slater and Deane Wilde have more than 30 years of combined experience in the Arizona swimming pool industry. Each of them oversees their projects from conception all the way thru to completion. So you never have to be concerned about being "handed off" to a company employee, or worse, to an outside contractor following the sale.</p>
      <p>Our personal approach to pool building ensures continuity throughout the process, allowing you to relax in knowing your project will turn out exactly as you had envisioned. </p>

                <p>Just a few lines to once again express our appreciation for the outstanding job you did in building our pool. Three weeks must be some kind of record. Every crew that came in was professional, knowledgeable and pleasant. All of their work was of the highest quality. The office staff was helpful, courteous and fun to work with. If more pool companies were as honest and reliable and had such a high quality of workmanship, there would be a lot more satisfied pool owners!</p>

                <p>I had some work done on my pool. Well, that is an understatement. I had my pool redone in March of '06. I went the typical route; I had 3 estimates, chose the least expensive and signed the contract. It wasn't long before I began to feel uncomfortable (always trust your instincts). To make a long story short, I cancelled the contract and went with Exotic Pools. Not the least expensive, but they did go out of the way to make sure everything was just as I wanted it. I was out of town most of the time and they kept in touch, letting me know how things were going. The pool is beautiful and I want to thank you for making things so easy, and for keeping me informed. It is not often you run into a company where customer service and integrity are a priority! Thank You!</p>
